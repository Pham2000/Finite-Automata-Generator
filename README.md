## Environment: 
This program will run in cmd line or through terminal.

## Program workings:
Program will be using python to generate a graphic, and analyze fsa through lisp
which will be using a test file. There are two batch file. Type p1 in cmd or terminal
which will let you run hardcoded lisp file which will let you test theString with
(demo). When type p2 in cmd or terminal the file will generate FSA graphic and lisp code
which can also be test by typing (demo). theString can be change manually. 

## Process:
Part 1 use a hardcoded program that analyze theString through recursion.
Part 2 generate FSA by analyzing the FSA text file and generate a lisp program
which can be tested same as Part 1.

## Result:
FSA graphic and a lisp program to test theString.

## Language:
Python and Lisp
